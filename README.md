## Project Overview

**Purpose:** A simple command-line application that allows a user to add students, record their scores, calculate averages, and display results.

This project is intentionally simple and suitable for learning **Python basics**, **software design**, and the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.

## 1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirements Analysis

**Functional Requirements:**

* Add a student
* Add scores for a student
* Calculate average score per student
* Display all students and their averages
* Exit the program safely

**Non‑Functional Requirements:**

* Easy to use (menu-driven)
* Runs in the terminal
* Written in Python 3


### 2. System Design

**Architecture:**

* Single‑file Python application
* Uses basic data structures (dictionary and lists)

**Modules / Functions:**

* `add_student()`
* `add_score()`
* `calculate_average()`
* `display_students()`
* `main()`



### 3. Implementation (Coding)

**File Structure:**

```text
student-grade-manager/
│
├── student_grade_manager.py
└── README.md
```


### 4. Testing

**Test Cases:**

* Add a new student → Success message
* Add score to existing student → Score stored
* Add score to non‑existing student → Error message
* Display students → Correct averages shown

Testing is done manually via the terminal.
